# No Man's Sky Resource Guide

This site is for players of the game No Man's Sky. This website allows players to view the resources in the game and view the details about them. This includes the components that the resources make and what resources are required for the component.

The user can search for resources in two ways, by clicking the reource tab and scrolling through the list of resources, or by searching for a resource via the search bar on the resource page. This applies in the same way for the components, via the components page. Once they find the resource or component they want they can click on the item and see the details for the item.

For resources, the user can see what the resource is used for, the sources in which the resource can be found, what the resources can be used to craft, what other resources it can be refined to get, and which resources are used to refine it.

For components, the user can see what resources and other components are used to make the component.

The user can login/sign up to the website so they can save resources to a list for quick reference.
An admin can add new resources and components to the site.

This site uses an API to access the data on the resources and components. Via API calls the user can retrieve the information about the resources or components they are looking for, and can save their list. The Admin can use API calls to add new resources and components to the database.
